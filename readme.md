# Evidence Protection System 

Our project focuses on developing an evidence protection system using
blockchain technology. The increasing reliance on digital evidence across
various domains necessitates robust solutions to ensure its integrity and
prevent tampering. Traditional methods struggle to address the challenges of
security and transparency. In response, our proposed system leverages
blockchain's decentralized and transparent nature to guarantee the integrity,
immutability, and transparency of digital evidence. By implementing this
system, we can enhance security, establish immutable records, promote
transparency, facilitate efficient collaboration, and instill trust in the
authenticity of digital evidence
